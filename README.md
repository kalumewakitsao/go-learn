# Go Leanining Path
This project is a roadmap on a GO tutorial as I walk down this [DevOps roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops). TDD has proved to be the best method of learning the concepts of the language, so I totally reccomend the [learn with go tests tutorial](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests).

# About The Project
This project is written in Go lang, as part of a follow up on the tutorial aforementioned.

# Getting Started
1. Install Go
